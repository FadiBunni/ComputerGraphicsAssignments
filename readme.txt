You can run the server application locally, by following these 5 steps:

1. Extract the content of the zip file.

2. Install the Apache server "Servez.Setup.1.0.1".

3. Run Serves.exe.

4. In the "Folder to Serve" choose the path leading to the extracted folder.

5. Press the buttons "start" then "Launch Browser".

We recomend that you use Google chrome, although the application should also work on Internet Explore.
