In order to get support for mouse clicking, we use the addEventListener on the "mousedown" event, which also stores the location of the mouse. By using getBundingClientRect, we can place the center of the vertex exactly where we click on the canvas.

For each click with the mouse, we add the created vertex to our buffer data.
