The shaders are loaded in using the script file "initShaders". 3 2-dimensional vertices are specified in an array, which are drawn with the drawArrays-function in the webGL library. The visual canvas by default has its center in 0,0 and a width/height of 2, so that it spans from x=[-1;1] and y=[-1;1]. The vertex locations reflect this property. When drawing, only a single render call is needed since frame is static. The glClear function sets the bitplane area of the frame to the color value previously set by glClearColor.

We get the vertex values to the GPU by putting them in a vertex buffer object. The fragment shader color is set to (0,0,0,1), which is black.
