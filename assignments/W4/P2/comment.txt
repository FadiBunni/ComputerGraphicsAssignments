We define the colors of each vertex to be (0.5+vPosition.xyz)/2.0. This value is then sent to the fragment shader. Since the sphere is now colored differently all around the sphere, we need to enable depth test in order to only draw the part of the sphere closest to us. When enabling back face culling, the result will be different than previously, since we now see the back of the sphere. Because of that, we change the sign of the z-component of each of the initial vertices.
